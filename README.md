# 👋 Hey there, I’m Jashan (@JashanKSran)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an IT enthusiast with a passion for **networking**, **server administration**, and **cybersecurity**. Whether I’m troubleshooting a network issue or learning the latest cybersecurity techniques, I’m always up for a challenge and excited to expand my skill set!

## 👀 What I’m into:
- **Networking**: Setting up and managing networks, making sure everything runs smoothly (and securely!).
- **Server Administration**: From configuring servers to troubleshooting issues, I love optimizing IT systems.
- **Cybersecurity**: The world of cybersecurity is my next big adventure, and I'm diving deep into learning how to protect systems and data from cyber threats.

## 🌱 Currently learning:
- **Networking**: Mastering network configurations, protocols, and troubleshooting.  
- **Server Administration**: Configuring servers, Active Directory, and working with DNS, DHCP, virtualization, and more.  
- **Cybersecurity**: Though I’m just getting started, I’m super excited to dive into securing systems, managing incidents, and understanding threats.

## 💞️ Let’s collaborate on:
- **Cybersecurity**: Got a project that needs a security boost? I’d love to help!
- **Networking & Server Admin**: Looking to work together on optimizing networks or setting up servers? Let’s make it happen.
- **Tech Projects**: I’m all about open-source contributions and love collaborating on IT and cybersecurity initiatives.

## 🧠 What Else I Know:
As part of my program, I’ve honed a wide range of technical skills, including:

- **C# .NET**: Crafting applications that are as solid as your favorite tech gadget (and just as reliable!).
- **SQL**: Writing queries faster than a database can respond (almost).
- **NoSQL**: Handling unstructured data like a seasoned pro—because not all data fits neatly into boxes!
- **MongoDB**: Managing big, wild datasets—think of it like having a personal data librarian who never forgets.
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**: Building web pages that are both stylish and functional—just like your favorite website, but with fewer pop-ups.
- **PHP & AJAX CRUD**: Creating dynamic web experiences that work behind the scenes (without the magic wand).
- **React.js**: Designing modern, slick user interfaces that feel as fast as a jet.
- **Python**: Automating tasks and writing scripts that make your life easier—basically, your own digital assistant.

These skills are part of my broad technical toolkit, but my main focus and passion lie in **networking** and **cybersecurity**, where I’m committed to securing systems and optimizing network performance.

**Bonus fun fact**: I approach problem-solving like a hacker in a movie—except with fewer explosions and more coffee. But hey, sometimes that's all it takes to crack the code!

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I’m always tinkering with tech—whether it’s configuring a new server or exploring the latest trends in **cybersecurity**. When I'm not coding, I’m probably reading up on the newest cybersecurity hacks (the ethical kind, of course), or helping others learn through peer tutoring!
